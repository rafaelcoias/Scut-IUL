## Assigment

The Scut-IUL platform is intended for managing the use of an automatic payment system for
tolls. In the Scut-IUL Platform, there are the following concepts:

  - Vehicle: vehicle driven by a driver, registered on the platform, characterized by the following
data: Make, Model, Color, License Plate and ID of the associated conductor.

  - Driver: the person who drives the vehicle. A driver must be registered on the defined platform
Scut-IUL With the following data â€“ ID, Name, Letter No., Contact, Taxpayer, Balance (in credits).

  - Toll: location for charging the highway usage fee. The toll is characterized by:
Toll ID, Lease, Assigned Highway, Usage Fee (in credits).

  - Usage report: report issued, containing the description of each toll usage
registered in the system, containing the Toll ID, Haul, ID of the associated driver,
vehicle, Fee charged, and Date of use.

In general terms, a new driver registers on the Scut-IUL platform providing their data, as well as
like those of the vehicle you own. When registering, each driver is assigned a value of 150 credits.

After registration, the driver will be able to use the automatic toll collection system.
Whenever the driver passes through a toll, the value of the usage fee is deducted from the respective
balance and added a row in the usage report. 

Tolls are pre-registered on the platform, containing the information described above.
